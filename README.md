# coi_tasks

I do not bother making pixel-perfect layouts. Never had a client or employer who measured the pixels. Responsivness and optical balance is more important.

For task 4 - I never used shopifiy, and have no way to render liquid code. This was made blind using only official documentation. I have no idea if it would work, but at least you can see my way of approaching the problem. I made a html file to test css in browser, and in liquid file I just made the values dynamic from schema.
